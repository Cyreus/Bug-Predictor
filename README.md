# What is this?

Error management and software quality are the top two most important parameters for the product you are developing. Therefore, I have conducted extensive studies on this topic. In my project, I developed a machine learning model using the Random Forest Algorithm to predict how many bugs might exist based on error logs, thereby measuring the quality of your software. With this highly successful model, your software is safe! All you need to do is upload your Python code file, either by directly uploading it or by providing the link to your GitHub repository, to measure the quality of your software.
